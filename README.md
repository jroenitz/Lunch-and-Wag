# Lunch and Wag
        
## Project Description

The user can share their location, or enter a zip code. A map on the page moves to that location and displays dog friendly restaurants. A list of restaurants also displays below the map with their addresses. The user can click the restaurants to get driving directions to them.


## User Story
```
    As a user with a dog
    I want a list of dog friendly restaurants near me
    So that I can decide where to eat and take my dog with me
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
    GIVEN that I shared my location or entered a zip code
    WHEN I view the main page
    THEN weather conditions are displayed
    WHEN I scroll down
    THEN I am shown an interactive map with locations of pet friendly restaurants marked
    WHEN I look below the map
    THEN I see a list of the restaurants currently on the map
    WHEN I click a restaurant
    THEN I am redirected to driving directions to that restaurant
```
